Notices
~~~~~~~

Notices are predetermined emails sent to members or membership applicants. They can be sent out based on the following criteria:

- # if days
- before, after, or at time of
- Join, Renewal, Expiration, Approval, and Disapproval dates

The Join date is set when they apply. You may want to set up notices to go out:

- 7 days before expiration to remind members to renew
- At time of (0 days) Approval, letting them know they have been accepted
- 15 days after Approval, again touching base and thanking them for joining
- 7 days after expiration, to see if they still want to renew (usually they can based on the Membership Type grace period)

Notices cannot be sent manually. Notices are more geared towards information related to a single member (their join date, their expiration date) and not really members on a whole. If several members are expiring at once, they will all receive an individual notice with information relevant to them. There is a list of available "tokens" that can be used to in the Notice Email content that are replaced with info relevant to that person.
