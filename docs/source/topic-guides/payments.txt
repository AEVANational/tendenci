Recurring Payments
==================

Tendenci supports recurring payments when using `Stripe`_ or `Authorize.net`_ as the payment gateway.

.. _`Stripe`: https://stripe.com
.. _`Authorize.net`: https://www.authorize.net

The steps for configuring recurring payments are covered on other pages, but there are some things to note before you can proceed.

Tendenci 7.4.1 or greater is required. See the `upgrade documentation`_ for more details on updating.

.. _`upgrade documentation`: http://tendenci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade/point-update.html

.. NOTE::
  If you want to know how to configure your tendenci.com payments see https://www.tendenci.com/help-files/recurring-payment-help/


Setting up
----------
Setting up the payment gateway is covered in help file `Setting Up Online Payment and your Merchant Provider on a Tendenci Site`_ and auto renew with Stripe is detailed on `a separate page`_.

.. _`Setting Up Online Payment and your Merchant Provider on a Tendenci Site`: https://www.tendenci.com/help-files/configure-online-payments-merchant-provider-tendenci/

.. TIP::
  If you create a recurring payment but your system is incorrectly configured you will need to delete the recurring payment and create a new entry.


Testing
--------

Stripe and Authorize.net manage their test systems differently. For Stripe, the procedure is to use a special `test only access key`_ while Authorize.net use `different API endpoints`_. Be sure you adjust your settings appropriately for the endpoint you have chosen!
