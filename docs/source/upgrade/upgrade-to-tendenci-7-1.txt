Upgrading from 7.0.x to 7.1.x
=============================

## DRAFT FOR WHEN TENDENCI 7.1 GETS PUSHED TO MASTER ##

Warning: this is a transitional upgrade that moves back to pulling from master from all repos or pypi. 

Step 1: Back up your site and database
--------------------------------------

If you're using docker, backup your docker container:
::

docker commit <site_name> backup/<site_name>:<your tag>

Uninstall the following modules from your virtualenv or your server.
::

    pip uninstall tendenci-case-studies
    pip uninstall tendenci-committees
    pip uninstall tendenci-donations
    pip uninstall tendenci-speakers
    pip uninstall tendenci-staff
    pip uninstall tendenci-studygroups
    pip uninstall tendenci-videos

Step 3: Update some files
-------------------------

These 2 files need to be manually updated:

    - conf/local_settings.py
    - conf/local_urls.py

In "conf/local_settings.py",

replace:
::

    'committees',
    'case_studies',
    'donations',
    'speakers',
    'staff',
    'studygroups',
    'videos',

with:
::

     'tendenci.apps.committees',
     'tendenci.apps.case_studies',
     'tendenci.apps.donations',
     'tendenci.apps.speakers',
     'tendenci.apps.staff',
     'tendenci.apps.studygroups',
     'tendenci.apps.videos',
     'tendenci.apps.testimonials',
     'tendenci.apps.social_services',



In conf/local_urls.py,

replace:
::

     ('^', include('committees.urls')),
     ('^', include('case_studies.urls')),
     ('^', include('donations.urls')),
     ('^', include('speakers.urls')),
     ('^', include('staff.urls')),
     ('^', include('studygroups.urls')),
     ('^', include('videos.urls')),
     ('^', include('testimonials.urls')),
     

with:
::

    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.committees.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.case_studies.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.donations.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.speakers.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.staff.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.studygroups.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.videos.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.testimonials.urls')),
    (r'^', include('tendenci.apps.social_services.urls')),

One new file needs to be added

    requirements/tendenci.txt
    
Add the following content to the file requirements/tendenci.txt
::
    
    https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/archive/master.zip
    # tendenci>=7,<8  # replace the above link with this later 

    https://github.com/epantry/django-sql-explorer/archive/master.zip
    


**IMPORTANT**: All future upgrades will completely overwrite the contents of this file with
the latest version from the tendenci repo version of "tendenci.txt". Think of it as a
"tendenci specific version of common.txt" - but we don't want to overwrite common.txt
so we don't break other developers modifications. This is a compromise. The master file
lives in the tendenci core project 

    /tendenci/templates/requirements/tendenci.txt

Yes, the project specific requirements/tendenci.txt file is not consistent with django standard naming conventions. Given the choice, we are choosing to respect the developers out there and not risk overwriting someone else's common.txt file.

Required: update dev.txt and prod.txt in the requirements directory of your project root to include the new tendenci.txt file.

    -r tendenci.txt

**REQUIRED**: Edit the your common file to remove redundancies with the new tendenci.txt file if you are doing an upgrade (most likely it should be blank now).

    requirements/common.txt
