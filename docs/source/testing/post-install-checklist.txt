Post Installation Checklist
===========================

Philosophy
----------

This idea of the checklist is to confirm that the site has been set up correctly. This is NOT a to-do list to build a Tendenci site. If you are hitting more than one or two errors, stop, and push it back to your developers and project manager. This is for quality control only.

For developers you will note that many of these tests can be done using unit tests or selenium which is a far better method than having a human verify these things. We can look at this as a list of tests that need to be written for Tendenci while acknowledging there will always be a human element to quality control.

Basic Functionality Testing
-----------------------------

1. [x] Newsletter Sending Has been Tested
  - Set up a test group. Send a newsletter. Make sure content is coming through. Has footer content been customized?

2. [x] Email sending from site is tested and sender address is client's email
  - Do a password reset and confirm you received the email

3. [x] Redirects have been tested
  - If they are using /redirects - click links in the lilst. Try in a new browser window when you are specifically NOT logged in.

4. [x] 404 page has search bar (Debug=True is off)
  - Test the reflex. Make up a page that doesn't exist example:(/blah/blah) and see what the result is. Note that example link has two slashes to see if the images break.

5. [x] The security, 403 page is working properly
  - Not logged in try to access a page that requires you to be logged in. Make sure you are prompted to login.

6. [x] Merchant account has been tested
  - Donation form is a good way to test /donations or use /py

Site Content Basic Review
-------------------------

1. [x] Verify homepage is not pulling in demo/blank content. If an auto feed (one of our modules or something like a twitter feed) is set up and not pulling any content in.

2. [x] Favicon and apple-touch-icon.png are logo

3. [x] Check Title Tag Spelling and Unique Meta and keywords on homepage. 
  - Do a view source to see what is pulling in for <title></title>. 
  - Make sure there is no duplicate wording there. (changes to title tag can be made here: /theme-editor/?file=/templates/homepage.html)

4. [x] Page titles are H1's on interior pages and no duplicate H1s on homepage or interior page
