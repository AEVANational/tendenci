Post Installation Checklist
===========================

Philosophy
----------

This idea of the checklist is to confirm that the site has been set up correctly. This is NOT a to-do list to build a Tendenci site. If you are hitting more than one or two errors, stop, and push it back to your developers and project manager. This is for quality control only.

For developers you will note that many of these tests can be done using unit tests or selenium which is a far better method than having a human verify these things. We can look at this as a list of tests that need to be written for Tendenci while acknowledging there will always be a human element to quality control.

Basic Functionality Testing
-----------------------------

1. [x] Newsletter Sending Has been Tested
  - Set up a test group. Send a newsletter. Make sure content is coming through. Has footer content been customized?

2. [x] Email sending from site is tested and sender address is client's email
  - Do a password reset and confirm you received the email

3. [x] Redirects have been tested
  - If they are using /redirects - click links in the lilst. Try in a new browser window when you are specifically NOT logged in.

4. [x] 404 page has search bar (Debug=True is off)
  - Test the reflex. Make up a page that doesn't exist example:(/blah/blah) and see what the result is. Note that example link has two slashes to see if the images break.

5. [x] The security, 403 page is working properly
  - Not logged in try to access a page that requires you to be logged in. Make sure you are prompted to login.

6. [x] Merchant account has been tested
  - Donation form is a good way to test /donations or use /py

Site Content Review
-------------------

1. [ ] Verify homepage is not pulling in demo/blank content. An example might be an auto feed from the photos module but no photos have been added.
  - twitter feed - verify it is using latest twitter embed code
  - facebook feed - *make sure* it is using latest FB embed iframe method or the site will run very slow waiting on FB

2. [ ] Favicon and apple-touch-icon.png are logo

3. [ ] Check Title Tag Spelling and Unique Meta and keywords on homepage. 
  - Check "Site Display Name", "Site Primary Keywords", and "Site Secondary Keywords" first. These are located at /settings/site/global/
  - Do a view source to see what is pulling in for <title></title>. 
  - Check for duplicate wording. 
  - *Danger* You can override dynamic title tags in the theme editor: /theme-editor/?file=/templates/homepage.html but this is a terrible idea. Instead check your base.html file in theme, that homepage.html is extending from base. Then check that your homepage.html is doing a block.super either at the front or back of the title tag block in your homepage.

4. [ ] Page titles are H1's on interior pages and no duplicate H1s on homepage or interior page

Contact and Custom Forms
------------------------

1. Verify the official "contact" form is using the "contacts" module and not the custom forms module. There are many technical reasons for this beyond the scope of a checklist. 

2. Custom forms - a necessary evil. Verify all forms if used on the site are in "published" status
  - Logout. Make Sure you still see them. Submit form to test.
  - Default Contact form has client email address to receive copies and text approriate for client
  - Test if admin receives notification as well.
  - Make sure "Send Copies To" field is filled out on custom forms
  - Verify completion URL and/or submission text is updated to make sense for the site (no "lorem ipsum" etc)

Edit Default Data to Make Sense
-------------------------------

*To Repeat - this should already have been done because this is a QA checklist*
1. Unused Applications disabled in /admin/
  - Check if default users have email address ending in @<YOUR DOMAIN NAME>. Maybe delete them but be careful for deleting relational data.
  - Company listed as <WHATEVER YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME IS>
  - Edit, don't delete, default user groups. *warning* Edit/Don't Delete.
  - Test pages edited to be relevant or possibly removed or set to draft where appropriate. (Recommended - Please check with project manager before deleting)

2. Test invoices have been voided

3. Images are using alt tags throughout the site

4. Site has been checked in an html validator (https://www.onlinewebcheck.com/check.php) and on http://www.site-analyzer.com

5. Optional: Test site speed (http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/)

6. H2, H3 etc. subtitle tags are in place across the site

7. HTML Sitemap is linked in the footer and is functioning properly

8. check /robots.txt - if it is set to disallow all update your sitesettings to make it public. Make sure robots.txt links to your sitemap.xml file which is generated dynamically as well

9. check /sitemap.xml to be sure it is updating and can be crawled by google.
